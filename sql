--A recap on subqueries:
--Subqueries are SQL queries that can run on their own, but give an output that's
--helpful for getting the right solution for the outer query. 

-- Example: Return all transactions where the amount is greater than average
--Hmmm... maybe this?
SELECT * 
FROM payment
WHERE amount > AVG(amount);
-- NOPE! DOESN'T RUN: "ERROR:  aggregate functions are not allowed in WHERE clause"

-- What about HAVING?
SELECT *
FROM payment
HAVING amount > AVG(amount);
-- NOPE! "ERROR:  column "payment.amount" must appear in the GROUP BY clause..."
-- And we're not grouping anything, so that won't work either!

Sooo... Subquery!
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount > (SELECT AVG(amount) FROM payment);
-- It runs! NOTE that the subquery returns 1 number, 
-- So "WHERE amount > (SELECT AVG(amount) FROM payment)"
-- Is the same as "WHERE amount > 4.2"
-- This is a very useful application of subqueries.


-- ANOTHER EXAMPLE: Getting 1 value from a subquery
-- Eg. Let's say you wanted all purchases with the staff ID that has serviced the fewest transactions.
-- ie. the staff_id with the smallest COUNT(*)

SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE staff_id = (SELECT staff_id
				 FROM payment
				 GROUP BY staff_id
				 ORDER BY COUNT(*); -- this subquery lists staff_id's in order of number of transactions, but returns 2 values
                  
-- ERROR:  syntax error at or near ";" -- Wow, doesn't give you any clue what's wrong
-- what's wrong is the subquery returns the values staff_id: 1,2
-- but the "WHERE staff_id =" is expecting just ONE number
-- so use "LIMIT 1" at the end of the subquery
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE staff_id = (SELECT staff_id
				 FROM payment
				 GROUP BY staff_id
				 ORDER BY COUNT(*)
				 LIMIT 1); -- add 'LIMIT 1', now it runs!

                  
-- EXERCISES - each one has an 'a' and a 'b' part. The 'a' part is the subquery for the 'b' part.
-- 1a) What is the average length of all the films?
SELECT AVG(length)
from film;
-- 1b) Return all films with shorter than average length.
SELECT * 
FROM film
WHERE length < (SELECT AVG(length)
                FROM film);

-- 2a) What is the smallest rental rate	in the database?
SELECT *
FROM film
WHERE rental_rate = (SELECT MIN(rental_rate)
                      FROM film);
-- 2b) Return all films with the lowest rental rate (using a WHERE claus)
SELECT film_id, title, rental_rate
FROM film 
WHERE rental_rate = (SELECT MIN(rental_rate)
                    FROM film);


-- 3a) What is the average payment amount in the database?
SELECT AVG(amount)
FROM payment;
-- 3b) Return all payments with below average payment amounts
SELECT * 
FROM payment
WHERE amount < (SELECT AVG(amount)
                FROM payment);

-- 4a) What is the customer ID who made the earliest payment?	
SELECT customer_id, payment_date
FROM payment
ORDER BY payment_date
LIMIT 1;

-- 4b) Return all purchases from the longest standing customer	
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE customer_id = (SELECT customer_id
                    FROM payment
                    ORDER BY payment_date
                    LIMIT 1);			

-- 5a) What rating ('PG', 'G', etc) has the least films?
SELECT count(film_id), rating
FROM film
group by rating
order by rating;
-- 5b) Return all films that have the rating that is biggest category 
-- (ie. rating with the highest count of films)
SELECT *
FROM film 
WHERE rating = (SELECT rating
                FROM (SELECT count(film_id), rating as numb_of_film_per_catg
                       FROM film
                       GROUP BY rating
                       ORDER BY rating desc
					   LIMIT 1) AS highest_ratings);
